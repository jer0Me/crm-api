# GET STARTED

The best way to get started with this project is to download Docker where you can do so here https://docs.docker.com/ 

Once you have installed Docker in your machine, the only thing left is to execute the following command in the project root folder:

**docker-compose**

Everything needed to run this project is already wired up. Therefore you do not need to do anything else, just execute the above command.
